<objective>
Polish all interactive element hover and focus states across the app with smooth transitions, subtle micro-interactions, and consistent timing. Primary action buttons gain a slight scale-up on hover for tactile feedback.

Purpose: Addresses POLISH-03 (hover states with smooth transitions including transform, opacity, and border-color). Every interactive element should feel responsive and polished.

Output: All button, chip, card, and interactive elements across the app have consistent, smooth hover feedback.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Polish primary action buttons and landing page interactions</name>
  <files>components/topic-picker.tsx, components/conversation-panel.tsx, components/confidence-check.tsx</files>
  <action>
Add subtle scale transform to primary action buttons for tactile hover feedback. Use `hover:scale-[1.02]` (2% scale-up) and upgrade `transition-colors` to `transition-all duration-150` where applicable.

In `components/topic-picker.tsx`:
1. **"Start learning" button:** Add `hover:scale-[1.02]` and change `transition-colors` to `transition-all duration-150`.
2. **"Begin conversation" button (API key flow):** Same treatment -- add `hover:scale-[1.02]` and change to `transition-all duration-150`.
3. **"Watch demo" button:** Add `hover:scale-[1.01]` (lighter touch for secondary action) and change to `transition-all duration-150`.
4. **Topic chips:** Add `hover:scale-[1.03]` (slightly more for small elements) and change to `transition-all duration-150`.
5. **Topic input:** Add `transition-all duration-150` so focus ring animates in smoothly. Currently has no transition class.
6. **API key input:** Same as topic input -- add `transition-all duration-150`.

In `components/conversation-panel.tsx`:
1. **"Send" button:** Add `hover:scale-[1.02]` and change from no explicit transition to `transition-all duration-150`.
2. **Textarea input:** Add `transition-all duration-150` so the focus ring animates smoothly. Currently has no transition class.

In `components/confidence-check.tsx`:
1. **"Send" button:** Add `hover:scale-[1.02]` and add `transition-all duration-150`.
2. **Textarea input:** Add `transition-all duration-150`.
  </action>
  <verify>
1. Run `npm run build` -- build succeeds
2. Grep for `hover:scale-\[1.02\]` in topic-picker.tsx -- should find it on Start learning and Begin conversation buttons
3. Grep for `hover:scale-\[1.02\]` in conversation-panel.tsx -- should find it on Send button
4. Grep for `hover:scale-\[1.02\]` in confidence-check.tsx -- should find it on Send button
5. Grep for `transition-all duration-150` in topic-picker.tsx -- should find multiple instances
6. Grep for `hover:scale-\[1.03\]` in topic-picker.tsx -- should find it on topic chips
  </verify>
  <done>All primary action buttons (Start learning, Begin conversation, Send) have hover:scale-[1.02] micro-interaction. Topic chips have hover:scale-[1.03]. Watch demo has hover:scale-[1.01]. All transitions use transition-all duration-150 for smooth animation of color, transform, and focus ring.</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Polish secondary interactions (session list, replay controls, header)</name>
  <files>components/session-list.tsx, components/replay-controls.tsx, components/app-header.tsx</files>
  <action>
Polish remaining interactive elements for consistent hover feedback.

In `components/session-list.tsx`:
1. **Session rows:** Add a hover background to the row container div (currently has no hover state). Change the row class to include `hover:bg-[var(--color-surface)]/50 transition-colors duration-150 rounded-md` (the rounded-md prevents clipping against the parent border-radius). This gives rows a subtle highlight on hover.
2. **Action buttons (Load, Export, Delete):** Change `transition-colors` to `transition-all duration-150` for consistency. These already have good hover colors.

In `components/replay-controls.tsx`:
1. **buttonBase class:** Change `transition-colors` to `transition-all duration-150` for consistency across all replay buttons.
2. **Auto-play/Pause button when active:** The active state already colors text indigo. No additional change needed.

In `components/app-header.tsx`:
1. **Theme toggle button:** It already has `transition-colors`. Change to `transition-all duration-150` for consistency.
2. The header action buttons (Export, New topic, Try it live, Exit) are rendered via children in the shell components, not in app-header.tsx. Those buttons already have `transition-colors` which is sufficient -- do NOT modify shell files from this plan (they belong to Plan 01's file set).
  </action>
  <verify>
1. Run `npm run build` -- build succeeds
2. Grep for `hover:bg-\[var\(--color-surface\)\]` in session-list.tsx -- should find row hover background
3. Grep for `transition-all duration-150` in session-list.tsx -- should find it on action buttons
4. Grep for `transition-all duration-150` in replay-controls.tsx -- should find it in buttonBase
5. Grep for `transition-all duration-150` in app-header.tsx -- should find it on theme toggle
  </verify>
  <done>Session list rows have hover background highlight. All secondary action buttons use transition-all duration-150 for consistent micro-interaction timing. Replay controls have smooth transition behavior. Theme toggle has consistent transition timing.</done>
</task>

</tasks>

After both tasks complete:
1. `npm run build` passes cleanly
2. All 6 modified files exist and contain expected hover/transition changes
3. Every primary action button has hover:scale-[1.02] micro-interaction
4. Session list rows have hover background
5. All transitions use consistent 150ms timing
6. No file conflicts with Plan 01 (different file sets)

<success_criteria>
- POLISH-03 (hover states): Every interactive element has smooth visual feedback on hover with consistent transition timing
- Primary buttons: scale + color transition
- Secondary buttons: color transition with consistent timing
- Session rows: background highlight on hover
- Topic chips: scale + color + border transition
- All transitions: 150ms for micro-interactions (separate from 300ms global theme transition)
</success_criteria>

After completion, create `.planning/phases/12-design-polish/12-02-SUMMARY.md`
