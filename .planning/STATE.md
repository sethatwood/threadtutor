# Project State

## Project Reference

**Core value:** The system prompt is the product. A well-prompted Claude that teaches through Socratic questioning, with a UI built around learning rather than chatting.

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 8 phases derived from 40 requirements following architectural dependency chain
- [Roadmap]: Phases 3 and 4 can parallelize (both depend on Phase 2 only)
- [Roadmap]: Phase 6 (Replay) depends on both Phase 3 (Concept Map) and Phase 5 (Session Persistence)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Research]: System prompt effectiveness for Socratic teaching is inherently iterative -- budget time in Phase 1 for prompt iteration with 15+ turn test conversations
- [Research]: max_tokens 2048 may still need adjustment based on actual response sizes -- monitor stop_reason in Phase 1
